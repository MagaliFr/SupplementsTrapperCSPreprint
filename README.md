Supplementary appendices (S1–S2) for the EcoEvoRxiv preprint “<Preprint Title>” (DOI: https://doi.org/<preprint-doi>). 

Because EcoEvoRxiv does not host these files directly, this repository serves as the canonical, versioned record. Releases mirror the preprint: v1 corresponds to preprint v1, v2 to v2, etc.; see CHANGELOG for revision notes. 


__Contents:__ Appendix S1 — Technical details; Appendix S2 — User interface and functional features of the Trapper Citizen Science platform
